This project demonstrates a simple web application for scanning plant leaves. The code has been separated into three files to show a typical, organized web development file structure.

File Descriptions:
index.html: This file serves as the foundational structure of the application. It contains all the necessary HTML elements, including the input form for image uploads, the display area for the leaf photo, and the sections that will dynamically show the diagnosis and scan history. It also contains the <link> and <script> tags that connect to the separate CSS and JavaScript files, ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

style.css: This file contains all of the custom CSS rules for the application. While the project heavily uses utility classes from Tailwind CSS for rapid styling, this file provides additional, specific styles. This includes the keyframe animations for the loading spinner and the hover effects on the dashed file upload box, adding a more polished and interactive feel to the user interface.

script.js: This is the core of the application's functionality and interactivity. The script handles event listeners for user actions, such as selecting an image from their device and clicking the "Scan Leaf" button. It simulates a processing delay and then dynamically generates the diagnosis and advice. Most importantly, it manages the persistent scan history by saving and loading results to and from the browser's Local Storage, allowing users to review their past scans.

To run this application as a single, self-contained file, the contents of style.css would be placed inside a <style> tag within the <head> of index.html, and the contents of script.js would be placed inside a <script> tag before the closing </body> tag. This combines all the code into one document for a simplified execution environment.
